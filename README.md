# Alapha API

This is an example API repo. The repo will hold an entire APIm but for this demo, we are only going to be using the `workspaces` directory. 

That directory will have sub-directories for every workspace Kong Enterprise that is using a Kong dev Portal. We will use the [Portal CLI](https://github.com/Kong/kong-portal-cli) to sync changes to the portal via Github Actions.
